# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption


# Introduction

This Python script allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a certain number of places down the alphabet. It's a classic and straightforward method of encryption and decryption.

# Features

- Encryption: Shifts each letter in the plaintext forward in the alphabet by a specified number of positions.

- Decryption: Shifts each letter in the ciphertext backward to reveal the original message.

- Alphabet: Uses a predefined list of lowercase alphabets (['a', 'b', 'c', ..., 'z']) for both encryption and decryption.

- Input Validation: Ensures valid input for encryption/decryption direction ('encode' or 'decode'), message text, and shift amount.

- Interactive User Interface: Prompts the user to input direction ('encode' or 'decode'), message text, and shift amount. It also offers an option to restart or 
  terminate the program.
